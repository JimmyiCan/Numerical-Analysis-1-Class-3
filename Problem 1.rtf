\f0\fs24 \cf0 15 orders of magnitude separate the value of the residual and the value of the condition number. \
When the condition number increases, it implies that the matrix is being more singular. Meanwhile, the error in the computation rises as well. They vary in the same speed so the difference between their magnitudes is always 15. You can see in my program as N changes, it is always that 15 orders of magnitude separate the value of the residual and the value of the condition number.}
